    <h2>Ensuring Flexibility and Adaptability</h2>
    <p>To ensure our AI system remains flexible and adaptable to new technologies, we will implement a <strong>Microservices Architecture</strong>.</p>
    
    <div class="note">
        <h3>What is Microservices Architecture?</h3>
        <p>Microservices architecture is a design approach where a system is divided into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Steps for Implementing Microservices Architecture</h2>
    <ol class="green-bullets">
        <li><strong>Divide the System:</strong> Break down the AI system into smaller services based on functionality (e.g., NLP, data analysis).</li>
        <li><strong>Develop Independently:</strong> Develop each service independently using the most suitable technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Deploy Separately:</strong> Deploy each service separately, allowing for individual scaling and updating.</li>
        <li><strong>Use APIs:</strong> Use APIs for communication between services.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor and Manage:</strong> Use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes for managing and scaling services.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Benefits of This Approach</h2>
    <ul class="green-bullets">
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Easy to update or replace individual components without affecting the entire system.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Can scale specific services as needed, rather than the entire system.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology Diversity:</strong> Different services can use different technologies, allowing for best-fit solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Faster Development:</strong> Teams can work on different services simultaneously, speeding up development and updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Fault Isolation:</strong> Issues in one service are less likely to affect the entire system.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>
    <ul class="green-bullets">
        <li>Ensure strong API design and management practices.</li>
        <li>Implement robust monitoring and logging across all services.</li>
        <li>Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for consistent deployment environments.</li>
        <li>Establish clear service boundaries and responsibilities.</li>
        <li>Plan for data consistency and management across services.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="note">
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>Begin by identifying the core functionalities of our AI system and planning how to divide them into microservices. Then, create a roadmap for gradually transitioning our current architecture to this new microservices approach.</p>
